My Group Project: Detect AI-Generated context from Human-Generated context.

This file describes the development and evaluation of classifiers for detecting and classifying AI-generated and human-generated text. Using integrated methods and feature analysis, through extensive experiments, we identified key findings about classifier performance, feature importance, and model diversity. Overall, this research helps maintain academic integrity as well as the integrity of information on online platforms in the face of the proliferation of AI-generated content.
